# LauncherForOakwood

That program is some kind of launcher for Oakwood ver. RC2 (Mafia: TCOLH multi-player modification)

What can this program:
1) Write and read launcher.json and client.json files from "config" folder
2) Configure parameters from above listed files and rewrite files with specified changes
3) Run the multiplayer after confirmed settings.
4) Save the recently saved Mafia and Oakwood directories and read them after next launcher run

It's necessary to specify the Mafia and Oakwood paths for the changes to be made correctly and avoid of unexpected errors and issues.

Special thanks to: 
- Smelson (Vanya Shatilov) - for providing an idea to create this thing and helping me.
- AsaSK - for background image to the program :)
- Mafia Bar - for improving some minor stuff in code.
- And, finally, MafiaHub dev team - for the multiplayer.

If you found any bugs, don't be hesitate to tell about this. ;)
